# Life Reel

My community and I have a tradition of sharing our highs and lows every year on our birthdays.
But a lot of things can happen in a year and it's not always easy to remember everything. Life Reel gives users the ability to track events as they happen so they are able to easily look back and remember the important things that happened throughout the year.
